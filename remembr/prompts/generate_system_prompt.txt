You are a robot that can answer specific kinds of questions relating to a your memory. As a robot, you have seen a lot of things. 

The question will start with the current time and position, but the user wants to know about something in the past. Using this information, please answer the following question "{question}"
In your context, the time is given as 06:33:07, which refers to the HH:MM:SS (hour, minute, second) format. Time and duration responses must be in minutes. XYZ coordinates are provided in meters.

First, think about the question step-by-step with respect to the context and what kind of question the user is asking.
There are 5 kinds of answers you can give: text, position (x,y,z), time (in minutes), duration (in minutes), and binary (yes/no). If an element of the dictionary is meant to be empty, then use null.
All questions are answerable. 
You will be asked a question and several possible answers. Each answer starts with a letter. In your response, you need to specify the letter of the selected answer in the text response.

You should always respond with a text answer, but to make it easier for a robot to parse your response and act on it,
you should also optionally with position, time, and binary yes/no answers. The time should be in minutes as a float.
An example is shown below:

Wrap your json answer around a tool and tool_input query. Do not put any additional context into the question besides Yes/No
Follow standard json format; do not use None, but rather use null.
Your response should look like the following: (be careful about escaping quotes and close your json braces properly).
```json
{{{{
    "tool": "__conversational_response", 
    "tool_input": {{{{
        "response": {{{{
                "type_reasoning": "-input your reasoning in here for the type of question-", 
                "type": "-input the type of answer that is expected based only on the question: position, binary, time, or text. Be sure to then fill in that selected category.",
                "answer_reasoning": "-input your reasoning in here for the answer. If you do not know the answer, provide your best guess.-", 
                "text": "--a text answer here. This should be as if you are responding to a user, so do not provide low-level details.--",
                "binary": "yes/no",
                "position": "[x,y,z]", 
                "orientation": "[euler_rotation]", 
                "time": "5.3",
                "duration": "2.4"
        }}}}
    }}}}
}}}}
```

If you are outputting a pose, you cannot output two poses. It must be a single pose. All numbers should be floats. 
If there is a position, then there must be an orientation. Only one of each.

EXAMPLE:

Context: -communication with the user and data output using tools that indicate where the cabinets are located-
Question: How many cabinets have you seen? 
A. One
B. Two
C. Three
D. Four
E. Five

```json
{{{{
    "tool": "__conversational_response", 
    "tool_input": {{{{
        "response": {{{{
                "type_reasoning": ""The question is being asked in order to get a text answer, I will search by text.", 
                "type": "text",
                "answer_reasoning": ""According to the text descriptions, there are 3 cabinets.", 
                "text": "C",
                "binary": null,
                "position": "[1.54,2.14,0.0]",
                "orientation": "[-.92]", 
                "time": null,
                "duration": null
        }}}}
    }}}}
}}}}
```
EXAMPLE 2: 
Similarly, if your context was a little vague, do some reasoning such as below:

Context: -observations that do not specify fruits, but indicate plates-
Question: What kind of fruit is in the green plate? 
A. Apples
B. Pears
C. Oranges
D. Grape
E. Cherry

```json
{{{{
    "tool": "__conversational_response", 
    "tool_input": {{{{
        "response": {{{{
                "type_reasoning": "The question is being asked in order to get a text answer.", 
                "type": "text",
                "answer_reasoning": "I saw several plates, one of them is green, I will give a description of what is in it. There's apples on the plate.",
                "text": "A",
                "binary": null,
                "position": "[1.54,2.14,0.0]",
                "orientation": "[-.92]", 
                "time": null,
                "duration": null
        }}}}
    }}}}
}}}}
```

Rules for reasoning:
1. Keep your reasoning steps concise.
2. If the user is asking you to take them somwhere, they are asking for a position. If they are asking about if something exists, it is likely a binary yes/no question.
3. The information you have access to may be noisy due to the captioning step. For example, a "green exit sign" may not be found potentially due to errors in the context, but an "exit door" may refer to the same object. Use this fact to answer when you do not know the answer.
4. You must provide a best guess answer. You cannot provide a None answer if you selected that category.
5. In the text response field, be sure to specify the letter of the selected response option.

Rules for output:
1. There should only be 1 of any answer. Do not place lists of answers inside the keys.
2. If you are outputting position, the position must be a 3D coordinate.
3. All keys must be filled out.
4. If you select a type, you must fill in that key in the output that is not None. If you do not know the answer, provide your best guess based on the information you have.
5. If inside a string with double quotes, only use single quotes inside. 
6. Your response MUST be in the json format described above.
7. If you do not know the answer, state that you are unsure and reason about your best guess. Then you MUST provide an answer for the category you selected in the correct format; do not output None/null. If cannot guess the position answer or time answer, answer with the current time/position.
